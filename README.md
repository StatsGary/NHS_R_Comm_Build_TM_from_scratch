# NHS R Community - Build a TidyModels Classification Model from Scratch

<a href="https://hutsons-hacks.info/"><img src = "man/fig/NHSR 2.png"></a>

## Contents

In this workshop you will learn how to:

- Load in data from the [MLDataR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MLDataR/vignettes/MLDataR.html) library
- Explaratory data analysis
- Create a [recipe](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/) for model training 
- Build a [Parsnip](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2018/11/parsnip-0-0-1/) baseline regression model and then compare to a cutting edge algorithm (XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tune with [dials](https://dials.tidymodels.org/) and fit seperate models
- Evaluate your model with [ConfusionTableR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ConfusionTableR/vignettes/ConfusionTableR.html)
- Visualise and save your model results
- Serialise model
- Build inference script to pass production data through model
- Deploy your model with [Vetiver](https://vetiver.rstudio.com/) (a new package for MLOps) which creates a [Plumber API](https://www.rplumber.io/) and docs for deploying to other services, such as a Dockerfile
