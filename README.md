## Contents

In this workshop you will learn how to:

- Load in data from the [MLDataR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MLDataR/vignettes/MLDataR.html) library
- Explaratory data analysis
- Create a [recipe](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/) for model training 
- Build a baseline regression model and then compare to a cutting edge algorithm (XGBoost)
- Evaluate your model with [ConfusionTableR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ConfusionTableR/vignettes/ConfusionTableR.html)
- Visualise and save your model results
- Serialise model
- Build inference script to pass production data through model
- Deploy your model with [Vetiver](https://vetiver.rstudio.com/) (a new package for MLOps)
